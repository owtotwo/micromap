A much faster alternative of
[`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html),
for very small maps.
It is also faster than
[FxHashMap](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-hash),
[hashbrown](https://github.com/rust-lang/hashbrown),
[ArrayMap](https://github.com/robjtede/tinymap),
[IndexMap](https://crates.io/crates/indexmap),
and _all_ others.
The smaller the map, the higher the performance.
It was observed that when a map contains more than 20 keys,
it may be better to use the standard
[`HashMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html),
since the performance of `micromap::Map` _may_ start to degrade.
See the [benchmarking results](#benchmark) below.

**WELCOME**:
Not all functions that you might expect to have in a map are implemented.
I will appreciate if you contribute by implementing these
[missing functions](https://github.com/yegor256/micromap/issues).

First, add this to `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
micromap = "0.0.16"
```

Then, use it like a standard hash map... well, almost:

```rust
use micromap::Map;
let mut m : Map<u64, &str, 10> = Map::new(); // allocation on stack
m.insert(1, "foo");
m.insert(2, "bar");
assert_eq!(2, m.len());
```

Pay attention, here the map is created with an extra generic argument `10`.
This is the total size of the map, which is allocated on stack when `::new()`
is called. Unlike `HashMap`, the `Map` doesn't use heap at all. If more than
ten keys will be added to the map, it will panic.

Read [the API documentation](https://docs.rs/micromap/latest/micromap/).
The struct
[`micromap::Map`](https://docs.rs/micromap/latest/micromap/struct.Map.html)
is designed to be as closely similar to
[`std::collections::HashMap`][std] as possible.

## Benchmark

There is a summary of a simple benchmark, where we compared `micromap::Map` with
a few other Rust maps, changing the total capacity of the map (horizontal axis).
We applied the same interactions
([`benchmark.rs`][rs])
to them and measured how fast they performed. In the following table,
the numbers over 1.0 indicate performance gain,
while the numbers below 1.0 demonstrate performance loss.

The experiment [was performed][action] on 25-03-2025.
There were 1000000 repetition cycles.
The entire benchmark took 244s.
Uname: 'Linux'.

As you see, the highest performance gain was achieved for the maps that
were smaller than ten keys.
For the maps of just a few keys, the gain was enormous.

## How to Contribute

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and then:

```bash
cargo test -vv
```

If everything goes well, fork repository, make changes, send us a
[pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run `cargo test` again. Also,
run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.

Also, before you start making changes, run benchmarks:

```bash
rustup run nightly cargo bench
```

Then, after the changes you make, run it again. Compare the results.
If your changes
degrade performance, think twice before submitting a pull request.
